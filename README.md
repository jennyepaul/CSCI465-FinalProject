# CSCI465-FinalProject
This project was written for my CSCI465- Enterprise Application Environments class. We had to utilize and combine JCL, Cobol, and Assembler to create a finance report.

This project makes use of subprograms and the combination of assembler and Cobol language. We had to write our main program in Cobol, write a subprogram in Cobol that built a table,
then utilize another subprogram to write the other table in assembler language, and finally we had a third subprogram that the main used to calculate share value in an assembler language.
This project was a great test of my assembler and Cobol skills and helped to bring everything I learned in my CSCI465 - Enterprise Application Environments class and my previous semeseter's
CSCI360 - Assembly Language class together.

This .txt file contains the code as well as the output for the report that had to be generated.
